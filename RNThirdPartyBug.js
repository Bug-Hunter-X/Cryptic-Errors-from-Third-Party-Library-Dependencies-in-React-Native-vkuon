This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that depends on another library, but the latter is not correctly installed or linked in your project. This often leads to cryptic error messages that are difficult to trace back to the root cause.  For example, you might encounter errors related to native modules, which can be very hard to debug.  Let's say you're using a library called 'react-native-maps' which depends on a native map module. If this dependency isn't properly linked, you might get errors during the build process or runtime crashes without much clarity.
