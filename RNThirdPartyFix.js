The solution involves meticulously reviewing the documentation of the third-party library and its dependencies.  You need to ensure the native parts are correctly linked, often through a combination of steps:

1. **Check Library Documentation**:  Carefully read the installation and setup instructions for the problematic library. Make sure to follow all steps precisely.
2. **Clean and Rebuild**: Try cleaning your project's build cache (`react-native clean` or equivalent).
3. **Verify Native Module Installation**: Depending on the library, you may need to run specific commands like `pod install` (for iOS), `./gradlew clean` (for Android), or `react-native link` to link the native modules. These steps are often crucial for resolving dependency issues.
4. **Examine Gradle/Podfile**: Investigate your `android/settings.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` (Android) or your `ios/Podfile` (iOS) to ensure all necessary dependencies and settings are present and correct.
5. **Debug Native Modules**: If the problem persists, consider using Android Studio or Xcode debuggers to step into the native code and identify the exact location of the error.  This usually involves more advanced debugging techniques.
6. **Use a Debugger**: Attach a debugger to your application and step through the code execution to pinpoint when and why the error occurs. Examine the library's code if necessary. 

**Example (Illustrative - replace with your actual library and commands):**

```javascript
// RNThirdPartyFix.js
// ... (Import necessary modules)

// Correctly link native modules (this is highly library-specific)
// Example for iOS: 
// cd ios && pod install

// Example for Android: 
// ./gradlew clean && ./gradlew assembleRelease 

// ... (rest of your code)
```
