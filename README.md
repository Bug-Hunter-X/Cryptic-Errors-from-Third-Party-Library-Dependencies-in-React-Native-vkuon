# Cryptic Errors from Third-Party Library Dependencies in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common yet challenging issue in React Native development: cryptic errors stemming from problems with third-party library dependencies.  The example focuses on a scenario where a library's native module dependencies are not correctly linked.  The lack of clear error messages often makes these issues hard to diagnose.

## Problem
The `RNThirdPartyBug.js` file illustrates a project attempting to use a hypothetical map library (`react-native-unclear-maps`, which doesn't actually exist, to represent a common scenario). The missing or improperly linked native dependencies lead to vague and unhelpful error messages.

## Solution
The `RNThirdPartyFix.js` file showcases how to resolve this: by ensuring all native dependencies of the third-party library are properly linked (usually through steps described in the library's documentation). This may involve running specific commands (like `pod install` for iOS or react-native link), correctly configuring your `android/settings.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle`, or making sure all necessary native modules are correctly installed.
